# AnyBody Chebyshev linkage model

AnyBody model of the chebyshev linkage

The Chebyshev linkage is a mechanical linkage that converts rotational motion to 
approximate straight-line motion.
It was invented by the 19th century mathematician Pafnuty Chebyshev who studied 
theoretical problems in kinematic mechanisms. One of the problems was the 
construction of a linkage that converts a rotary motion into an approximate 
straight line motion. This was also studied by James Watt in his improvements 
to the steam engine.
